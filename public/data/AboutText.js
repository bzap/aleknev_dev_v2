    background: `Hi! My full name is Linas Aleknevicius. More recently, I\'m a Computer Science graduate from McMaster University and a full-stack Software Developer with AviaPro Consulting Inc. I try to maintain an interest in all forms something, but I have a particular passion for front-end designs and implementations. There\'s just something satisfying about bridging the gap between what the developer sees and what the user experiences. A well thought out, lively interface makes the interaction feel humanized, and less of a machined process.
                \nWhen I\'m not developing something I might be bouldering or furthering my quest for the endgame mechanical keyboard. The latter of which I\'ve come to think of as a paradox by now. Ask me about the builds I have (or have had in the past)!
                \nCurrently I\'m looking for new opportunities as a developer! Hire me?`,
