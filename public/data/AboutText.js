    background: `Hi! My full name is Linas Aleknevicius. I\'m a recent Computer Science graduate from McMaster University with a particular interest in full-stack development and passion for all things code. 
                \nTo me, development is all about being able to problem solve and work together to bring creative solutions to life. As a full-stack developer in particular, there\'s just something satisfying about bridging the gap between what the developer sees and what the user experiences. A well thought out, lively interface coupled with a seamless backend is the epitome of this. Pair this with how the field is ever evolving, and there\'s just this sense of excitement in learning new tools and languages to bring on a new approach to my work. 
                \nWhen I\'m not developing something I\'m always on the lookout for the next best dan-dan noodle spot in the city (Szechuan Noodle Bowl, anyone?) or furthering my quest for the endgame mechanical keyboard. The latter of which I\'ve come to think of as a paradox by now.
                \nCurrently I\'m looking for new opportunities as a developer! Hire me?`,
