    background: `Hi! My full name is Linas Aleknevicius. I\'m a  Computer Science graduate from McMaster University with a particular interest in full-stack development and passion for all things code. There\'s just something satisfying about bridging the gap between what the developer sees and what the user experiences. A well thought out, lively interface coupled with a seamless backend is the epitome of this.
