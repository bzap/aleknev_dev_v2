## Background
Prior to working on this project, I had little experience with building websites without the use of frameworks and UI tools such as React and Material UI. To combat this and deepen my knowledge, I set out to see what kind of design and implementation I could come up with using plain and simple HTML and CSS. 
<br/>
One of my main goals was to have smooth, and consistent CSS animations when interacting with the interface. Aspects like word highlighting and satisfying dropdown menus were a priority. This project taught me a lot about animating keyframes and syncing elements between transitions. 
<br/>
Towards the end of development, I found I was having trouble with animating the dropdown menus, where it became tedious trying to combine multiple animations at the same time, while still balancing the color of certain elements. I ended up breaking my rules and using jQuery for that alone. The use of jQuery greatly simplified these DOM and CSS manipulations.

## Breakdown
The primary script is split into a few different key operations. The first is the word (sentence) generator that takes a JSON of sample words and uses a simple algorithm to randomize them by their length. 
<br/>
The second is a counter that keeps track of the time elapsed and updates the statistics based on it. This one proved tricky at first as I was accustomed to the way state works in frameworks such as React. This meant continuously updating elements was not as simple as creating a state and having it update on its own.

</Center>
<br/>
The last key operation is what I used to alleviate the previously mentioned problem. Itâ€™s a rendering call based on the time elapsed, used to calculate the correct statistics and display them to the user.
